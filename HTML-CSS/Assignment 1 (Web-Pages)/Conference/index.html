        <br><br><br><br>The first known use of "conference" appears in 1527, meaning "a meeting of two or more persons
        for discussing
        matters of common concern".<br> It came from the word confer, which means "to compare views or take counsel".
        However the idea of a conference far predates the word.<br> Arguably, as long as there have been people, there
        have
        been meetings and discussions between people. Evidence of ancient forms of conference<br> can be seen in
        archaeological ruins of common areas where people would gather to discuss shared interests such as "hunting
        plans,<br> wartime activities, negotiations for peace or the organisation of tribal celebrations".
